* TODO/DONE:
  * find out how to get /etc/inittab from gentoo into Manjaro's systemd equivalent!
  * get rid of this in dmesg:  i8042: ------------------------4294849049
    \ in my kernel patches
  - set up ~/.xinitrc
  - get rid of the audit: dmesg lines from chromium!
    * CONFIG_AUDIT in kernel seems to be needed only for consolekit(in gentoo) ?
      * removed and recompiled kernel!
        \ looks like this was systemd (now starting with -AUDIT) tapping into the kernel audit! (especially since this didn't happen on gentoo, with openrc)
  * find out if led_class kernel module is actually needed!
    * look into kernel sources or Kconfig files!
  - //nah, I'm using its hooks capability! // maybe get rid of NetworkManager completely?
    * see how to manually set up network!
  * remove pamac
    \ will pacman -Syu manually
    \ because this starts every time I connect cable: /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99_update_pamac_tray
  * see why I can't Shift+PgUp in fbcon mode on console
    \ there are no lsmod|grep fb
  * find a way to get systemd's console text into a log file and see what's that yellow UNSUPP
  * replace ntpd with crony(?)
    * see how to use crony on arch wiki!
    * remove ntpd
      \ and thus ntpd.service is gone, so we don't have to worry about this starting: /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/10-ntpd
    * update script: ~/bin/updclock
  * get rid of this vlc msg
    \ Failed to open VDPAU backend libvdpau_r600.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  * get vsync to work, get gentoo's xorg.conf into manjaro
    - get vsync to work
    * make xorg.conf better! not into multiple files which apparently cannot override the settings properly!
  * merge my options into /etc/inittab
  * /etc/inputrc
  * overlayfs for psd
    \ https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Profile-sync-daemon#What_is_overlayfs_mode.3F
  - uninstall ufw! (not working with my custom kernel - much headache, I'd rather do it manually then)
  - see #TODO
  - explicitly mount /tmp as tmpfs with the size= parameter!!
    \ see how to do this by looking in gentooskyline
