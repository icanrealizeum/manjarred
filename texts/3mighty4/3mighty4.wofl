  * set Options for Add/Remove Programs
    * DON'T set 'Remove unrequired dependencies' (because this removes qt4 when trying to remove cups, and vlc can optionally use it; and I just realized I don't have 'mc' anymore(supposedly I've had it?) else this setting removed it when I didn't notice)
    * add AUR and stuff, but not by default!

      \ Security tab
      \ untick 'Lock screen when system is going for sleep'
      \ set 'Automatically lock the session' Never

      \ it's already executable!
    * start it

    * to connect from client
      \ ssh -v -p 46802 -l a -L 5900:localhost:46802 lmighty4

  * fstab
    * settings for the btrfs root:
      * backup /etc/fstab with .ORIG extension (via cp -a --)
      * set the btrfs options in fstab, replace with:
        \ async,relatime,rw,suid,dev,exec,loud,ssd,compress-force=lzo,datasum,datacow,space_cache,commit=300,enospc_debug,discard
        \ nouser is unrecognized!

      * mount / -o remount
        \ it now has all the new options!
      * time btrfs filesystem defragment -r -v -clzo /
        \ 2m46.722s (total ? failures, redirected 2>/dev/null so I dno)
        \ down from: 6416480 to: 4895356
    * tmpfs-es
      \ add these lines in /etc/fstab (there's no such thing there already! but /tmp is already 50% tmpfs!)

    - change the discard flag for swap into discard=pages
      \ otherwise it will also do discard=once which is at swapon, and it seems like a bad idea, UNLESS! eg. on reboot or swapoff, no discard is done for the already allocated hmm...
  * from Power Manager->Display (in UI) set display to never turn off, or it will never wake up (it's black screen!) - set Display power management to Off (this disabled sleep and turn off settings! leaves blank one enabled)
    \ blank works though
    \ ensure 'Switch off after' is Never
    \ the other two from above(blank and sleep) can remain! - they both work!
    \ set them to 20 and 21 mins
    \ well that's great something else locked it up now!
    * set System power saving under System tab to Never!
  * right click Start Menu->Properties->Behaviour, Ignore Favorites, Display by default, 50
    \ to show recently used instead of favorites!
  * edit /etc/hosts
    \ add the hostname to both 127.0.0.1 and ::1  to avoid that outgoing DNS request

  * sudo vim /etc/resolvconf.conf
