WHAT THIS PACKAGE DOES

  This package provides the ISO image files of BIOSes which are compatible with
  CD/DVD/BD writing software to create the CD/DVD/BD for the BIOS update.
  Hereafter the CD/DVD/BD for the BIOS update is called as "BIOS Update CD".

  The BIOS Update CD can boot the computer disregarding the operating systems
  and update two sets of the BIOSes (including system programs and Embedded
  Controller programs) stored in the following ThinkPad computers to fix
  problems, add new functions, or expand functions as noted below.

  - BIOS ID 7Uxxxxxx-based computer
      (Upper two alphanumeric characters of BIOS ID are 7U)
  - BIOS ID 7Vxxxxxx-based computer
      (Upper two alphanumeric characters of BIOS ID are 7V)

  For that purpose, it is necessary to have the CD/DVD/BD writing software (with
  CD/DVD/BD creation function from the ISO image file) prepared separately.

  Also, any one of the following types of CD-RW, CD-RW & DVD Combo, DVD, DVD
  Multi, BD or other optical drives should be prepared. (Hereafter these drives
  are called as "optical drive".)
  - ThinkPad internal
  - USB
  - Ultrabay installed in the Docking Station

  This program is language independent and can be used with any language system.

NOTES

- You should install the CD/DVD/BD writing software which supports CD/DVD/BD
  creation function from the ISO image file to create the BIOS Update CD.

- To boot the computer from the BIOS Update CD, you should have any one of the
  following types of optical drives.
  - ThinkPad internal
  - USB
  - Ultrabay installed in the Docking Station
  Any types of PC Card, CardBus PC Card or ExpressCard optical drive are not
  supported.

- The contents of the BIOS Update CD can not be shown by Windows Explorer.

- If you use Windows Vista, before applying this BIOS into the system, you
  should install Windows Vista KB 937500. The information of KB937500 is located
  in the following Microsoft's site.
    http://support.microsoft.com/kb/937500/en-us

  To verify if KB937500 is installed properly,

  Engine Firmware" version 4.1.3 or higher must be installed into your computer.

- If system protection function by Intel Anti-Theft Technology PC Protection,
  ConstantSecure Remote Disable or ThinkVantage Hardware Password Manager
  feature is still activated and when you try to get back to the older BIOS
  versions without these features, the following message will be displayed.
  This is to prevent system protection function from being deactivated.

  BIOS Update CD:
    "Error  The system program file is not correct for this system"
  BIOS Update Utility:
