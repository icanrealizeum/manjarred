* find out why bash completion for tlp isn't working? file is in: /etc/bash_completion.d
* urxvt
  * make shift+mousewheel scroll horizontally (shouldn't be too hard by modyfing the mouse scrollwheel patch)
  - investigate a slowdown and cpu 100% usage issue with urxvt when it processed many screens of text, works in normal screen but also with secondScreen (ie. less) it will scroll slower as PgDn is held during less, and scroll faster again as PgUp is coming near the top of the file in less.
  \ this doesn't seem to happen with seq  seq 100000|less
  \ but happens with grep -r kernel --exclude-dir=.config --exclude-dir=build|less  in my home dir (i see lots of urls tho)
  \ wow PgDn scroll is done line by line, i just realize - it became that slow that I can see it - maybe less is doing this line-by-line scrolling, and it's slow because urxvt got slow although since we're in secondScreen, it isn't really supposed to be storing the scrolllines, right?
  \ FOUND: it's because of long lines (no \n) like 72000 chars line will slow down pagedown scroll in less to the point that you can see line-by-line scrolling when trying pagedown once.
  * find out why switching window to bigger (Ctrl+Alt+4) causes:

  \ while compiling linux-git
  \ and when pacman is prompting it exits with: :: Proceed with installation? [Y/n] -----------
  \ that --- is from pacman, supposed to be on next line tho
  \ NOTE: this also happens during mouse window resize(ie. Alt+F8) when size changes (rows/columns!)
  * (like impossible) make ability to select with the mouse, more than one screen while in secondScreen (ie. less) - currently the selection deselects if moved outside top/bottom.

  - numpad PgUp/PgDn in less, not working
* vim
  * see why vim doesn't know how to indent PKGBUILD when function names contain _ and - such as package_linux-git-headers()  all inner code is indented with 0 spaces
  * numpad keys: up/down/Home/End/5/left/right (except PgUp and PgDn) are broken in vim!
    \ well it's because something was overriding xmodmap so I had to reload it: xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
    - fixed that by making sure /etc/profile reloads xmodmap from ~
      * found it! - sometimes pacman installs execute this: source /etc/profile  which does change the mapping of keys and requires running: xmodmap ~/Xmodmap !! finally this issue is found!
    * TODO: test open vim and enter insert mode then Ctrl+Left to see if it works, if it doesn't make sure xmodmap is loaded in xinitrc ! 'cause this fixes it when reloading it in terminal.
    \ maybe that's why I was getting some lockups in mc with keypad keys hmm
      * nope that's not why, see why keypad keys and up/down of non-keypad keys for example(not just them) lock-up in some cases, not sure what's the fix! but xmodmap (re)loading isn't it but seems to happen after a vim session while in mc. Could be urxvt doing it, quitting the terminal altogether is the "solution" for that terminal. Starting up a new one works fine, but just quitting mc, loading xmodmap and starting mc again doesn't unlock the keys.
        \ this is a different issue, apparently related to mc !! probably not urxvt because I remember xfce4-terminal having the same issue in mc
        \ this doesn't modify xmodmap at all! at least not the -pke part And the -pk part!
        \ but quitting mc and re-entering does fix it! and what brokes it is running a command, like ls, then when back: broken  ie. keypad star  key
        \ changing folder(ie. enter on it) fixes it also!
        * need to check if executing 'cd' (when pressing enter on a folder) does anything different from executing a cmd like 'ls' - maybe the former restores some things!
  - see why vim doesn't enter second screen (as per urxvt) but less does
    \ so, while in vim, mousewheelup will scroll past the vim screen into what was in the shell before
    \ actually less doesn't either, at least when there's scrollback(which is not what you have when you just started the terminal)
    \ works with jjacky's mouseWheel patch

* need a way to crypt (probably using pub/priv keys) such that there are two keys: one for read and one for write; so that if read is ever required (eg. for the govt.) then only the read key needs to be provided; so this way they cannot implant evidence.
  \ although they can still write physical sectors and could in theory brute force write stuff and check the read data for validity to what they actually want to write - so this way they could eventually write whatever they wanted.
  \ Unsure how possible this is atm.

* put ssh key on a luks container or something and mount only when needed
  * make a symlink of the keyfiles to the where container will be mounted
  * make ssh alias which would mount container if it wasn't mounted, and possibly unmount it when done

* replace echo -n  with printf?
  \ https://github.com/gentoo/netifrc/pull/10#issuecomment-76241328

* this is nolonger valid about deleted certs inside firefox
  \ src: https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:UserCertDB
  \ "Important: Deleting a root certificate that is in the default root store is equivalent to turning off all of the trust bits for that root. Therefore, even though the root certificate will re-appear in the Certificate Manager, it will be treated as though you changed the trust bits of that root certificate to turn them all off."
  \ XXX: what actually happens is, you delete the cert(even if it has all 3 options unset: to not trust it to identify websites, email and software), it comes back with the trust it to identify websites bit set!!
  \ tested on https://forum.videolan.org/ with cert named UTN-USERFirst-Hardware  serial: 44:BE:0C:8B:50:00:24:B4:11:D3:36:2A:FE:65:0A:FD

- NEVERMIND: make a safer rm command, not an alias, but actually replace the existing rm with one that chdirs into the folder and removes whatever is left; well actually I didn't think this through because rm dir/ will cd dir; rm "" (nothing) or rm . which won't work (didn't test) but i guess there's already a test in place so you can't remove / by mistake, inside rm, since this is my intention with this anyway. Wonder if cd /dir ; rm -rf ../   removes what? or what happens, I don't wanna test yet. whatever

* interesting, bash globing is case-insensitive
  * eg. ls alien1.pi?  or ls *.pig or ls alien1.* will show ALIEN1.PIG file


* use this instead of sudo netstat -pantu

* need a way to prevent kernel from ever panic-ing and thus leaving me without the reason why it panic'd (in dmesg, since i can't use sysrq+s to sync while panic'd) - SO, disabled kernel panics!!

* use mitmproxy and genymotion  for snapchat app, in order to respect snapchat devs' wishes for not using 3rd party software  and still do what I want - have my cake and eat it too :)

- get audio from manjaro vbox to work in gentoo vbox  eg. lsmod

* modify sshd and ssh(client) to can auth using BOTH password and key(signature auth) so that first the pass is asked, then the key is used; if either fails, don't let it in; but if pass is ok, and if key fails then maybe give some other error(as to not alert whoever else is trying this, that a key was also tried and failed) like maybe say the pwd was wrong.
  \ yeah can't really do this, because their ssh client(with debug on) will show that it's trying with a key too! unless!!! there's an error that the pwd was wrong so that their ssh client will try next thing(the key) - even if the pwd was right! SO, this can still work! heh

- (nevermind! C-c won't work) stop using urxvt and use xfce4-terminal instead
  \ because urxvt github version isn't updated and the real one uses cvs! and it's bugged! even though xfce4-terminal does that make file in /tmp and unlink it thing which makes it "easy" to spy on the window's contents!
  * FIXME: no colors with less and man ! they were fine with urxvt, probably because now TERM=xterm  (can be set in options)
    - can't use xterm-color because: *** VTE ***: Failed to load terminal capabilities from '/etc/termcap'

  \ why? because, why make life harder for whoever is trying to access that data, even if they want to do it for evil reasons; and most importantly because denying accessibility like that(by using encryption/LUKS) will breed into my life and just like any type of hiding, supposedly, will prevent me from progressing!
  \ this also implies that I will do only what I want to do, not what my subconscious wants me to do while it feels under the protection veil of privacy.
  * will think more about how to protect stuff like .ssh/key  and keepassx passwords ...
  - let the browser user agent be normal (don't spoof/hide it)
    \ already in effect
  - don't use proxy for reading arstechnica (although this means no ads then? proxy would load them tho)
    \ done, not reading it anymore because it has to go http instead of https
  - ssh/key already has a password, maybe make it be stronger or longer; since there won't be LUKS on underlaying storage
    \ done
  * hmm, I guess all that grsecurity santitizing or memory/stack will slow down the system more than LUKS would have! so no gains there, unless I disable that. Maybe I should... maybe simpler is better, until I achieve my goal(my program).

- get udev rules.d from manjaro, into gentoo
* fix /etc/udev/rules.d/75-mac-spoof.rules to work on gentoo, currently has no effect!
  \ or just get rid of it entirely!

- get /etc/hosts from manjaro into gentoo

* investigate kernel scrollback bug
  \ when being switched to a vt (vc2) on second screen(eg. vim) then the first console vc1 being on first screen(not in vim, but on like bash command line) is losing scrollback that appeared while focus was on vc2
  \ or maybe it's not supposed to scroll up if the vt isn't active? recheck that patch!
  * see if scrollback only activates when the specific screen is selected! or even, when switched away FROM! 'cause that's bad too! 
    \ need all vts to have scrollback even if they were never activated! so that vt10->vt12 where dmesg is spewed have all lines available for scrollback when I switch to them for the first time!

* when you press Tab and it does NOTHING! (in make nconfig  on exit!)
  \ right-arrow key works though

- make piped command show exitcodes of 0 as black not as red! (in bash with my .bashrc PROMPT!)

- fix touchpad tap doesn't work as LMB in X, bare metal, gentoo
  \ works now, the default is to not allow tap to act as LMB (has setting in gui)

- fix sensor doesn't have all the other sensors... or doesn't have access to them; except the ACPI one which is the battery and the read-once-startup-only temps!
  \ fixed by adding lm_sensors USE flag, but not needed lm_sensors on startup because it doesn't create any config! (due to all kernel modules required are built into kernel, so they're not modules at all)

* in gentoo bare metal, xscreensaver (Ctrl+Alt+L) locks but fails to unlock regardless of the password being good!
  * disabled for now
  * TODO: actually fix it!

  \ this may only be needed inside virtualbox ?
  \ oh wait, there are virtualbox modules that depend on kernel, even when you're running virtualbox on host, not just for the guest-additions for the OS within the virtualbox;

      \ done!
  
* the boot time in gentoo is 37 sec, compared to like 12 sec in Manjaro
  * use something other than genkernel!!!
    \ which means: need to make my own scripts to make kernel, modules, append cpu microcode, mount and cp to /bewt/ , regen grub via grub2-mkconfig

- need to ensure kernel loads cpu microcode
  * cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep microcode
    \ if it's 0x3000014  then it's not loaded!
    \ should end in 27 I believe

- /etc/inputrc  and ~/inputrc (?)

* see why VirtualBox fails to start
  \ VMSetError: Failed to reserve physical memory (0x1004 -> 0x1000; VMMDev Heap)
  * look into Qemu/KVM
    \ this article: https://www.proteansec.com/linux/running-virtualboxvmware-hardened-gentoo/
    \ says that "In order to be able to boot virtualization software like VirtualBox/Vmware, we have to disable some PaX/Grsecurity options. Note that I didn't have any problems with all of the options enabled when using Qemu/KVM, which runs without any problems despite having all of the PaX/Grsecurity features mentioned below enabled."

    \ Dried spirulina contains about 60% (51–71%) protein.[2][3] It is a complete protein containing all essential amino acids, though with reduced amounts of methionine, cysteine, and lysine when compared to the proteins of meat, eggs, and milk. It is, however, superior to typical plant protein, such as that from legumes.[2][4][5]

      \ Enzymes /ˈɛnzaɪmz/ are macromolecular biological catalysts. Enzymes accelerate, or catalyze, chemical reactions. The molecules at the beginning of the process are called substrates and the enzyme converts these into different molecules, called products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life.
      \ Enzymes are known to catalyze more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types.[2] Most enzymes are proteins, although a few are catalytic RNA molecules.
      \ Like all catalysts, enzymes increase the rate of a reaction by lowering its activation energy. Some enzymes can make their conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds.[3][4] Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction.
      \ Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity. Many drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH.
