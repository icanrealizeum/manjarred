* incorrect udp checkums ? (seen with tcpdump) with software from within virtualbox
  \ fix: ethtool --offload eth0 rx off tx off ; ethtool -K eth0 gso off
  \ ^ apparently this works even when you get networking freezes right after you get 'Detected Tx Unit Hang' within virtualbox. - either that, or it just got better by itself. (but for example you couldn't even navigate in make nconfig due to the network delay/lags)

- kernel 4.2.0 rc2 (tag) crashes system when startx inside a virtualbox (4.3.26) so you should update to the immediate commits after it (specifically this: 4.2.0-rc2-g97d6e2b) - tested to not crash anymore.
  \ NOPE: it still OOPSes after a few minutes... so maybe that didn't get fixed at all!

  \ gdb /usr/lib64/xorg/modules/drivers/vboxvideo_drv.so

  \ works, shows:
  \ 0x839c is in VBoxVideoGetVRAMSize() (/usr/include/xorg/compiler.h:381).
  \ 381     __asm__ __volatile__("inl %1,%0":"=a"(ret):"d"(port));

  \ 906     pVBox->cbFBMax = VBoxVideoGetVRAMSize();
  \ that's why startx segfaults above, because of that 'Disable privileged I/O' CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_IO
  \ ok "fix" by disabling that option!

    \ Also worth noting that selecting Intel HD Audio(from the default ICH AC97) and then selecting back ICH AC97 will clear this codec flag and all is well. (OK must be pressed after each selection, ofc.) (This is in virtualbox on host, in Settings->Audio->Audio Controller )

    \ - Memtest freezes or my system crashes/reboots.
    \ Check that you have USB legacy support disabled in your BIOS setup. Some
    \ BIOSes have a bug in them that reports the reserved memory areas
    \ incorrectly in the e820 memory map. This causes memtest to write over the
    \ memory area used by the USB legacy support resulting in freezes or reboots.

* boot any iso from HDD if you already have a working GRUB and linux OS
  \ src: http://www.howtogeek.com/196933/how-to-boot-linux-iso-images-directly-from-your-hard-drive/
  \ src: https://www.system-rescue-cd.org/Sysresccd-manual-en_Easy_install_SystemRescueCd_on_harddisk#Boot_the_ISO_image_from_the_disk_using_Grub2
  * put iso somewhere
    \ eg. /home/z/a.iso
  * sudo fdisk -l
    \ see which partition has that file
    \ /dev/sda3 or in grub speak hd(0,3) which works even if it's (the /boot but) under LUKS
  * sudo vim /boot/grub/grub.cfg
    \ for manjaro and others see src: https://gist.github.com/gorhill/6561765
    \ add grub entry:
    * for system rescue CD iso
      \ menuentry "sysrescd ISO" {
      \ set isofile="/home/z/a.iso"
      \ loopback loop (hd0,3)$isofile #won't work with LUKS
      \ #loopback loop /$isofile #works with LUKS but only half-way! iso's initram needs to be able to open luks device where iso is stored
      \ linux (loop)/isolinux/rescue64 isoloop=$isofile setkmap=us dns=8.8.8.8 dostartx rootpass=/ nocache
      \ initrd (loop)/isolinux/initram.igz
      \ }
      \
      \ right, so setkmap=us to not get the prompt for keyboard
      \ nocache to can easily change to docache if wanted via 'e' key at grub prompt! but my test shows docache has no effect in this case!
      \ rootpass is the root password
    * for Manjaro
      \ for img_dev=/dev/sda3  can be /dev/disk/by-label/wtwlabelsda3hashere or /dev/mapper/luks_on_sda2_boot  where sda3 is the device which contains the .iso file
      \ XXX: you take the line with misolabel=MJRO1606 from inside the .iso under /isolinux/isolinux.cfg
      \
      \ menuentry "manjaro ISO" {

* ssh port forward
  \ eg. ssh -p 8822 -L 55900:127.0.1.2:5900 127.0.0.20 -l user

  * replace last type char with char 'l'
