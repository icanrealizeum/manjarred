          * steps to disable ipv6
            * Edit /etc/default/grub and add ipv6.disable=1 to your GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
              \ "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="ipv6.disable=1  quiet splash""
            * Edit /etc/hosts and hash out the IPv6 line,
              \ "#::1		localhost.localdomain	localhost"
            * sudo update-grub
              \ "which is apparently equivalent to: sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
              \ at least on linux manjaro 0.8.10"
            * reboot

            \ "https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Ipv6#Disable_IPv6"
          * For example, dhcpcd will continue to harmlessly attempt to perform IPv6 router solicitation. To disable this, as stated in the dhcpcd.conf man page, add the following to /etc/dhcpcd.conf: 
            \ "noipv6rs"

          * "I would like to criticize the press in its handling of the "hackers," [...]. The acts performed by these kids are vandalism at best and probably trespass and theft at worst. It is only the inadequacy of the criminal code that saves the hackers from very serious prosecution. The companies that are vulnerable to this activity (and most large companies are very vulnerable) are pressing hard to update the criminal code. Unauthorized access to computer systems is already a serious crime in a few states and is currently being addressed in many more state legislatures as well as Congress. There is an explosive situation brewing. On the one hand, the press, television, and movies make heroes of vandals by calling them whiz kids. On the other hand, the acts performed by these kids will soon be punishable by years in prison. I have watched kids testifying before Congress. It is clear that they are completely unaware of the seriousness of their acts. There is obviously a cultural gap. The act of breaking into a computer system has to have the same social stigma as breaking into a neighbor's house. It should not matter that the neighbor's door is unlocked. The press must learn that misguided use of a computer is no more amazing than drunk driving of an automobile."

          * so, if you remove X percent of something, then how much percent Y from what's left is equal to what you removed?
            \ "answer: Y=(X/(100-X))  % of what was left, you have to add to what's left and get the original quantity that you applied X on.
            \ example: 43% of 1234 = 530.62
            \ now remove 43% of that 1234  => 1234 - 530.62=703.38
            \ how much % of 703.38 do I have to add to 703.38 to get back to 1234 ?
            \ (43/(100-43))=(43/57)=0.7543859649122807 aka 75.44%
            \ 0.7543859649122807 * 703.38 = 530.619999999999998766
            \ 703.38+530.619= 1233.999

PC output volume; the volume on the headphones has no effect)

              \ lasted: 4 hours 6 mins  but I haven't used it as much for a while, that explains it!
              \ 
              \ charging from 07:58:00, done at: 08:00:31   so 2 min 31 sec charging time
              \ (that is until the led light turns off, though the systray icon still says charging 100%)
              \ (it's 18th march 2014 now, obviously)
              \ 
              \ from 08:02:30 discharging from 100% (800dpi still)
              \ it's 8:39 and it's still showing 100% ... i smell cheating
              \ 10:34 at 27% and turned off 'cause i go sleep or something
              \ 15:05:40 at 25%, turned on, i'm awake
              \ 15:29 at 2%, led is on, died.
              \ lasted: 2 hours 32mins +24mins = 2 hours 56 mins
              \ 
              \ 15:31:00 charging... until: 15:33:19  so 2min 19sec to full charge(that is, until led off)
              ----
              it's 19 march 2014
              from 04:33:50AM mouse discharging from 100%
              08:10:40 died, 2%, led flashing
              lasted: 3 hours 43mins
              
              was charging from 8:11:?? until: some seconds less than 8:13:40
              I'll assume it was 2 mins 30 sec
              
              08:14:15 discharging from 100%
              12:15 died
              lasted: 4 hours
              (i was afk for 1 hour maybe)
              
              12:15:15 charging, 3% jumped to 23% then 30% but led was flashing, so i guess it was out
              just that the report was like wrong in systray, oddly enough
              yeah i forgot it with cable on for a while... dno how much it took to charge...
              "
            * good thing is, you can keep the usb cable plugged in at all times even while the on/off switch is in OFF position (it will still transmit wireless; and as soon as you unplug it it stops, unless you turn it ON then it's capacitor powered)
            * switching from 800dpi to 1600dpi doubles the speed (which is obvious why, and should happen with every mouse, right?) and this entails having to go to control panel mouse settings and halve the acceleration!
              \ "there's a button on the mouse allowing the switch between 800dpi and 1600dpi (only these two settings, like a toggle)"
          * linux
            * make sure fbcon module is loaded (or CONFIG_EXPERT=N  to have it loaded it automatically) or else startx will black screen with FOSS radeon driver (not fglrx)
            * keepass2 (wine) will lockup sometimes when clipboard pasting happens and the workaround is `pkill xsel` - yes really! (oh, in linux mint 15 oliva 64bit)
