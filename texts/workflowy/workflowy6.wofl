          * "I would like to criticize the press in its handling of the "hackers," [...]. The acts performed by these kids are vandalism at best and probably trespass and theft at worst. It is only the inadequacy of the criminal code that saves the hackers from very serious prosecution. The companies that are vulnerable to this activity (and most large companies are very vulnerable) are pressing hard to update the criminal code. Unauthorized access to computer systems is already a serious crime in a few states and is currently being addressed in many more state legislatures as well as Congress. There is an explosive situation brewing. On the one hand, the press, television, and movies make heroes of vandals by calling them whiz kids. On the other hand, the acts performed by these kids will soon be punishable by years in prison. I have watched kids testifying before Congress. It is clear that they are completely unaware of the seriousness of their acts. There is obviously a cultural gap. The act of breaking into a computer system has to have the same social stigma as breaking into a neighbor's house. It should not matter that the neighbor's door is unlocked. The press must learn that misguided use of a computer is no more amazing than drunk driving of an automobile."

            \ "answer: Y=(X/(100-X))  % of what was left, you have to add to what's left and get the original quantity that you applied X on.
            \ example: 43% of 1234 = 530.62
            \ now remove 43% of that 1234  => 1234 - 530.62=703.38
            \ how much % of 703.38 do I have to add to 703.38 to get back to 1234 ?
            \ (43/(100-43))=(43/57)=0.7543859649122807 aka 75.44%
            \ 0.7543859649122807 * 703.38 = 530.619999999999998766

          - sometimes, in linux (mint and manjaro tested) one of the CPUs (CPU1 of 0-3) does not respond and it thus ignored for the session; a warm reboot will fix this
            - this is because DX-ECO Genius wireless mouse was turned on (reported this kernel bug)

            \ because of that lowercase L and uppercase i  looking practically the same, indistinguishable => unacceptable for me"
          * powering down(by holding power button for 4 sec) the laptop (while prompted by bios password(not when entering bios though) or whenever else, especially when unresponsive/locked up for some reason) then (hours later even) when you try to power on you see that the hdds (or ssds) are not being powered on or something(and takes more seconds to show startup password) because the hdd password isn't being asked and it tries to book from network card
            - "solve by going into bios F2 and now hdd password is asked, just save and exit (haven't tried to not save) - works"
            \ actually better to just ctrl+alt+del twice when you see it hangs before asking for system password; so don't get into bios at all
          * virtualbox(4.3.8 tested) is the only one(between it and vmware workstation 10.0.1 tested) which can pass TRIM from guest OS to host OS, and does so only when rotational and discard are set to true inside .vbox file for that drive (discard must be manually edited in) AND it will not pass TRIM to host if the partition where the virtualbox hdd file (.vdi) resides is truecrypt encrypted regardless if mounted in removable or normal mode.

            * this is why there can't be ssd trim passthru from virtualbox (that is, when using raw ssd as storage, not the .vdi files)

              \ http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html unfortunatelly there won't be any trim passing thru

          * LOGIC LH-50 wireless headphones are mono(EDIT: FM signal received is mono in the headphones) instead of stereo(EDIT: FM signal sent is stereo though! external radio can receive stereo and L/R tested to be true) - I guess it makes sense since they are working on the FM band; the headphones work well in stereo when the cable is connected directly(and the jack turns off the batteries ofc; and the volume stays fixed, depending on the input - ie. PC output volume; the volume on the headphones has no effect)
            * it seems that a normal radio device picks up the signal as stereo, so this would mean that only the headphones are unable to pick stereo signal from the receiver (unsure if from all/other normal radio stations too)
          * genius DX ECO mouse
            * how long does the charge last, as per my experience/usage (lasts almost 3 hours, like 2 hours 55mins avg; charges in 2min30sec or at most 3 min basically):

              ----
              it's 19 march 2014
              from 04:33:50AM mouse discharging from 100%
              08:10:40 died, 2%, led flashing
              lasted: 3 hours 43mins
              
              was charging from 8:11:?? until: some seconds less than 8:13:40
              I'll assume it was 2 mins 30 sec
              
              08:14:15 discharging from 100%
              12:15 died
              lasted: 4 hours
              (i was afk for 1 hour maybe)
              
              12:15:15 charging, 3% jumped to 23% then 30% but led was flashing, so i guess it was out
              just that the report was like wrong in systray, oddly enough
              yeah i forgot it with cable on for a while... dno how much it took to charge...
              "
            * good thing is, you can keep the usb cable plugged in at all times even while the on/off switch is in OFF position (it will still transmit wireless; and as soon as you unplug it it stops, unless you turn it ON then it's capacitor powered)
            * switching from 800dpi to 1600dpi doubles the speed (which is obvious why, and should happen with every mouse, right?) and this entails having to go to control panel mouse settings and halve the acceleration!
              \ "there's a button on the mouse allowing the switch between 800dpi and 1600dpi (only these two settings, like a toggle)"
          * linux
            * make sure fbcon module is loaded (or CONFIG_EXPERT=N  to have it loaded it automatically) or else startx will black screen with FOSS radeon driver (not fglrx)
            * keepass2 (wine) will lockup sometimes when clipboard pasting happens and the workaround is `pkill xsel` - yes really! (oh, in linux mint 15 oliva 64bit)
