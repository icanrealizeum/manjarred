  * set Options for Add/Remove Programs
    * DON'T set 'Remove unrequired dependencies' (because this removes qt4 when trying to remove cups, and vlc can optionally use it; and I just realized I don't have 'mc' anymore(supposedly I've had it?) else this setting removed it when I didn't notice)
    * add AUR and stuff, but not by default!

  * fstab
    * settings for the btrfs root:

  * from Power Manager->Display (in UI) set display to never turn off, or it will never wake up (it's black screen!) - set Display power management to Off (this disabled sleep and turn off settings! leaves blank one enabled)
    \ blank works though
    \ ensure 'Switch off after' is Never
    \ the other two from above(blank and sleep) can remain! - they both work!
    \ set them to 20 and 21 mins

    * set System power saving under System tab to Never!
  * right click Start Menu->Properties->Behaviour, Ignore Favorites, Display by default, 50

  * edit /etc/hosts
