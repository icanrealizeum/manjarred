This patch is to fix an issue in mc (midnight commander)
whereby sometimes the subshell output was truncated and if small enough
completely discarded.
The fix handles the case when the order of two different inputs
(shell output and the pwd from PROMPT_COMMAND) don't arrive in that order.
This happens sometimes and this is when the truncation was in effect.
Also note that shell being STOP-ped can also happen in any order with the above two.
