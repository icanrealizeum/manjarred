#1. IF pkg file doesn't exist then:
  #a) it recompiles (build), using existing srcdir
  #b) recreates pkg file, using existing srcdir (but recreates pkgdir)
#2. installs from existing pkg file


#source ./common.bash

#--nobuild (added to below command) makes it always fail to compile/do anything whether the pkg exists or not, so it's useless to add in this case.
#but without --nobuild it will build if the pkg doesn't exist, but it should just try --repackage instead and only if this one fails then it should try rebuild
#so we leave it without --nobuild for now, which means it will rebuild if pkg file doesn't exist, but will use existing folder because of --noextract and --noprepare prevents reaplying patches(since the srcdir folder is kept)

#XXX: if incremental was set then useincremental=("--incremental") otherwise useincremental=("--noextract")
#set -x
time makepkg -s --install --noprepare --noextract "$@"
#"${useincremental[@]}" "$@"

#time makepkg -s --install --noprepare "$@"
