requirements for powertop:
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/PowerTOP#Kernel
$ zcat /proc/config.gz |grep -iE '(CONFIG_TRACING|CONFIG_TIMER_STATS|CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IO_TRACE|CONFIG_TIMER_STATS|CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS)'
# CONFIG_TIMER_STATS is not set
CONFIG_TRACING_SUPPORT=y

that's what I currently have and seems ok enough for powetop
