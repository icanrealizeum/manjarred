add chromium-hotwording-2403.patch
but modify it first so that only the #ifdefs remain and rename and add a suffix to that symbol, so it acts as if it's always disabled!

----
done//tested to not work, just as if ffmpeg is missing
add to PKGBUILD, from gentoo:

local gn_system_libraries="
    flac
    harfbuzz-ng
    libevent
libvpx
    libwebp
    libxml
    libxslt
    snappy
    yasm
    zlib"
  if use system-ffmpeg; then
    gn_system_libraries+=" ffmpeg"
  fi

#more: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/build/linux/unbundle/replace_gn_files.py

build/linux/unbundle/replace_gn_files.py --system-libraries ${gn_system_libraries}

-----
nope//see if chromium-system-ffmpeg-r3.patch  is needed! we already have another similar one!
-----

if the above had no change, and cannot use external ffmpeg as player, then:

put back(to their defaults) these in args.gn

media_use_ffmpeg
media_use_libvpx

and then:

rtc_build_libvpx
rtc_build_opus
rtc_include_opus
rtc_libvpx_build_vp9

-------
then install pulseaudio-git

-------
try git versions of these packages:

local/libx264
local/x265
local/x264
