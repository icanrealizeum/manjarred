#As an example, suppose you are trying to find the commit that broke a
#       feature that was known to work in version v2.6.13-rc2 of your project.
#       You start a bisect session as follows:
#
#           $ git bisect start
#           $ git bisect bad                 # Current version is bad
#           $ git bisect good v2.6.13-rc2    # v2.6.13-rc2 is known to be good


#echo 'this will execute prepare too (which means: reapplies patches)'
#time makepkg --install  --force
./2recompile_and_inst

#//echo when done, do: git checkout .  to make sure the patches are cleaned
echo '1. reboot and test the newly installed kernel,'
echo 'then do: git bisect good OR git bisect bad (if errors "git checkout ." first'
echo then rerun this script
echo 'goto 1'
#//which will reapply the patches on the new bisect
