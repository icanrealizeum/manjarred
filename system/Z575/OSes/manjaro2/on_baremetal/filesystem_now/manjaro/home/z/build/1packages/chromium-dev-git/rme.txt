relevant file extensions to search into(with mc): *.gn*,*.gyp*,*.grd,*.idl,*.json,*.js,*.cc,*.h
-----
nevermind that(below section): use ./1_sync  to clone or pull(update) from internet
use that first time or any other times when you wanna update the sourcecode!
and any subsequent times! whenever you want to update the repo via eg. git pull

then use 1gngen (it's in a subfolder) to regen the /tmp/out/Default  folder when u had it deleted
this doesn't update source code which is good
1_sync already does what 1gngen does, after it's done updating source code from internet.

then use ./recompile to compile sourcecode into /tmp/out/Default (assumed tmpfs/RAM)

------- old:
Update: ignore this, just run ./upd  because PKGBUILD already does what i said below(depending on the case: first time, or subsequent times)
------ older:
Notes:
cd "/home/emacs/build/chromium-dev-git/fetch gclient base/checkout_root"

first time, within an empty ^ folder, did:
fetch --nohooks chromium
this will take at least 2 hours 34mins(154min7sec; 16GB) on like 10Mbps download
well with --no-history takes 29mins 6.7G apparently

fetch is from depot-tools-git


any other time:
gclient sync --jobs 16

^ must use python2 !

so use pythonic in both cases!
