#no effect: Aug 05 22:11:45 myzee kernel: systemd-journal: 2 output lines suppressed due to ratelimiting
#so both of the following are known then:
#RateLimitInterval=30s
#but only this has any effect(wtf?):
#RateLimitIntervalSec=30s
#^and why wouldn't THAT, if not specified, be the default of 30s?! and thus have the same effect! - well nevermind, must've been a fluke because after restart and systemd-journald restart again, i still get: Aug 05 22:10:25 myzee kernel: systemd-journal: 66 output lines suppressed due to ratelimiting
#XXX: ok, thanks to dreisner looks like those are comming from the kernel and not from systemd!
