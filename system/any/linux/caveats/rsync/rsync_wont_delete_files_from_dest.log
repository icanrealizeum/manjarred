rsync  version 3.1.2  protocol version 31

rsync won't delete files from destination if the containing folder isn't in included files list!
ie.
to delete /etc/resolv.conf in dest, you have to have /etc/ in included files (or / in included files)
if you have /etc/resolv.conf in both, still nothing happens(dest is not deleted)
